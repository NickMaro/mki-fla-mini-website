After separation there is a deadline of 2 years to divide the property you own with your former partner (this applies to de facto couples).
<br><br>
If you do not sign Consent Orders, a Binding Financial Agreement, or lodge an application with the family court in this timeframe, then you may be prevented from pursuing a property division (unless you get an extension from the court).
<br><br>
Unlike splitting property, there are no time limits in place in order to deal with caring arrangements for children under 18.
<br><br>
If you are out of time, then it's still possible to take action. We recommend you speak to a family lawyer because it can be complex.
