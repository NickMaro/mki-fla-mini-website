Until an order says otherwise, if property is jointly titled, both you and or your ex partner can have a right to live in your home. However you donâ€™t both have to stay living under one roof.
<br>
<br>
If you are scared or afraid for your safety, or there has been family violence, you may be able to have either court orders or an FVRO made to protect you.
<br>
<br>
If the property is in one person's name, the title holder has the right to possession.
