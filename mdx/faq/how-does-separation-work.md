Separation simply means that your relationship is over for good.
<br><br>
It means you're no longer together as a couple, you've stopped doing all the things that couples do and friends and family understand you are no longer together.
<br><br>
Nothing special is required for a separation, you don't need to sign any documents or give notice to any government departments to make the separation legal. All you need to make your separation legal is to tell your ex partner that the relationship is over for good.
<br><br>
You should make a note of the date that you separated. Often time limits are based on the date of separation (e.g how long you have to split your assets).
<br><br>
If you’re receiving social security benefits, you may be obliged to notify Centrelink that you’ve separated.
<br><br>
It’s also possible to live in the same house, and still be separated (it’s called being separated under one roof).
