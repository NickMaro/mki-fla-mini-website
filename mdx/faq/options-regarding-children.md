**1. Informal Arrangements**
<br><br>
This is where you and your ex partner informally share custody of your children. Nothing is in writing. Nothing is binding and you're free to change the arrangements as you please. This informal arrangement can work if you are both very amicable.
<br><br>
**2. Parenting Plan**
<br><br>
Parenting plan is a document that sets out how you and your former partner share custody of the children. The benefit of a parenting plan is that it sets out clearly (in writing) what each person’s expectations are. A parenting plan is not binding. Therefore each person can technically change their mind, but it’s better to have something in writing than nothing at all. Our family lawyers can prepare this for you.
<br><br>
**3. Consent Orders**
<br><br>
Consent orders can set out how you share custody of your children. They are lodged with the Family Court and the court will need to approve them.
<br><br>
Consent orders can only be made by agreement between you and your former partner.
<br><br>
Once consent orders are approved by the court, they are binding and cannot be changed without approval of the court or by entering into a later parenting plan.
<br><br>
Our family lawyers have lots of experience preparing consent orders.
<br><br>
**4. Family Dispute Resolution**
<br><br>
Family Dispute Resolution (FDR) is a process where you and your partner negotiate to try to come to an agreement about sharing time with your children. This is required unless you have good grounds to get an exemption (eg there is family violence or urgency).
<br><br>
FDR is a special type of mediation that is conducted by a qualified person. It’s a mediation so you are not forced to agree to anything. Any agreement is purely by consent of both of you. The FDR process is not about anyone making a decision for you (only the Family Court can do that). FDR is about helping you communicate with each other to see if an agreement is possible.

We can give you assistance on where you can start this process.
<br><br>
**5. Going to Court**
<br><br>
If you and your partner cannot reach an agreement then your only option is to commence family court proceedings. The court will make a decision regarding how much time you will spend with your children, where they live, how communication works, who makes the important decisions and more.
<br><br>
Before Family Court proceedings can be commenced, you need to obtain a certificate from a family dispute resolution process or apply to the court for an exemption (in the case of family violence).
<br><br>
We recommend you engage a family lawyer to help you navigate your way through the family court.
