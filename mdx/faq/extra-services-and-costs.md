‘Out of time’ costs may apply under certain timeframes. If you were married and have divorced, you have 1 year to finalise the split after the divorce. If you’re married and not yet officially divorced, this time limit does not apply to you! If you were not married (de-facto relationship), then you have 2 years since the date of final separation. Don’t stress... If you’ve passed these deadlines, we can still assist. The court simply requires some extra work to be done. We can help on your behalf at additional costs.
