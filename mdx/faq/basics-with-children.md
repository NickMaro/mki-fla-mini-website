When it comes to spending time with your children, it must be what’s best for the children, and not what’s best for the parents.
<br><br>
Children should have the opportunity to spend time with each parent (if possible), but often it is not practical for the time to be divided exactly equally.
<br><br>
If you cannot agree, as to how much time each of you spend with the children, we can help you take steps to get a fair arrangement in place.
<br><br>
Remember, you can only make arrangements for children under 18 years. Once a child is over 18 years of age they are free to make their own decisions.
