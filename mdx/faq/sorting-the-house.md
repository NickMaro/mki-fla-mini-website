In Australia, simply splitting the assets 50/50 is not how it works.
<br><br>
The house, bank accounts, business, shares, super, mortgage, credit card debt are divided in a manner that is fair.
<br><br>
How everything is split depends on many things including:
<br><br>

- what was brought into the relationship at the start;
- how much each person contributed financially during the relationship;
- contributions to the finances after the relationship ended;
- the length of the relationship;
- each person’s earning potential;
- if there are any health issues;
- who raised the children;
- who worked;
- who did the housework;
- age (e.g time left in the workforce);
- personal injury, workers compensation or redundancy pay-outs;
- inheritance, gifts from parents, or lottery winnings;
- causing the assets to decrease such as gambling, drug or alcohol addition;
- time the children spend with each parent after the relationship;
- raising children from another relationship (e.g. step-children);
- acting as a carer for the other person or elderly parents;
- and more….

  One of our Perth family lawyer can give you an idea of what’s a fair split of your assets and debts based on your circumstances. We usually give a percentage range (within 10%) of what you could be entitled to.
  <br><br>
  Then it’s a matter of negotiating with your ex-partner on how to divide everything.
  <br><br>
  If you can get an agreement, the best way to **make it legally binding** is signing consent orders. If you don’t get consent orders, anyone is free to change their mind and come back for more later on.

  While you can keep arrangements for the children informal – **you should always legally formalise arrangements for splitting the assets, debts and super.**
