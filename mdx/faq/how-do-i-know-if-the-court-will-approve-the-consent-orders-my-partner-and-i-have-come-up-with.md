Before the court will approve consent orders about your parenting agreement, it will scrutinise the orders to see if the arrangements are in the best interests of the children.
<br>
<br>
What constitutes the children’s ‘best interests’ is quite broad. There are two primary considerations and a long list of additional considerations that the court will take into account.
<br>
<br>
The primary considerations are:

- The benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents; and
- The need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
